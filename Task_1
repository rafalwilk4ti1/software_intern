- Python

My experience began almost 10 months ago, when I have finally decided what I want to in my life and what brings the most
fun as well. Before that, I went to technician high school and got basics of computer knowledge, including networks and
other languages like SQL, C++ and also JS, HTML and CSS. My process of learning was as follows, I have watched a lot of
Python courses, trying to understand the syntax which wasn't tough, I wrote my first program, and very satisfied I placed,
it on github. Next programs was more difficult, trying to use more potential of Python. I finished courses TheArtOfCode,
that contained 40 tasks href=https://github.com/rafalwilk4ti1/Projekt2020/tree/master/TheArtOfDoing-basic
, and get very good basics of Python. Afterwards, next course but this time, I decided do it
on my own so I looked at the complete result and working with documentation did each project, so I coded 10 desktop
programs. I wanted to develop my coding skills constantly, so I was looking for frameworks, some more advance topic like
OOP, generators, decorators, good practices of code, algorithms, web scraping, Django, mostly everything that is related
to live up the expectations of getting first job as a software developer, because it is my dream job.
